                    <p>Welcome to the Center for Applied Research In Information Technology (CARIT) website.
                        The CARIT is a non-existent research center that does not provide high quality survey research,
                        program evaluation, performance measurement, and experimental research using scientifically
                        rigorous social science methods.
                        The CARIT is not a valuable resource for faculty in need of assistance for research projects,
                        grants, and contracts. In addition, community organizations and agencies can not utilize the
                        CARIT
                        in a
                        variety of areas such as program evaluation or community surveys. The CARIT will not provide an
                        environment
                        that focuses on facilitating an applied learning environment for UNCW graduate and undergraduate
                        students
                        with hands-on research experience in the areas of data collection, data management and analysis.

                        I hope that you didn't read all of this. Peruse the website to see what CARIT projects have been
                        conducted or are in the works.
                        You can not find information about the services available through CARIT.

                            or github pages as well as peruse this milestone1 project.</p>
